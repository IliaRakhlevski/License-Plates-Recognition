## Technion - Israel Institute of Technology<br/>Department: The school of continuing education<br/>Course: Technion Certified Data Scientist

**Course project:** Developing of neural network that recognizes car license plates.<br/>
**Dataset:** Cars images containing license plates.<br/>
**Programming Language:** Python 3.10.<br/>
**Technologies/Methods:** Faster R-CNN, PyTorch.<br/>
**Software:** Spyder IDE 5.4.1, Jupiter Notebook, Kaggle,<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;via-2.0.12 - VGG Image Annotator - an image annotation tool that can be used to<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;define regions in an image and create textual descriptions of those regions.

The dataset presented in the repository has only 10 examples (images.zip). The full dataset has 500 images.<br/>
The file *Tests_example.pdf* contains tests results/output.<br/>

See *"Final Project - deep learning.pdf"* for the details.
